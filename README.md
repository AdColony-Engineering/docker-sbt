# docker-sbt

The images for [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) on Docker Hub are all sketchy or have been flaky lately. This is another one, but hopefully not sketchy _or_ flaky. It gets auto-built on Docker Hub and is just sbt on Debian Stretch with JDK 8. Nothing fancy, hopefully gets the job done.
